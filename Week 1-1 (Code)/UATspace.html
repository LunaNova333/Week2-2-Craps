        UAT Space is splendid. I advise you join if you are a space explorer,
        or you have the urge to delve deeper into the unknown.

    For our craps game on the html side, we need:
        1. Button to play craps
        2. crap status line
        3. Header saying craps played here

        The time is now, fellow space cadets, to play a mere, and simplistic game of Craps. 
        This game, is not just any game of Craps, for this game determines the fate of our 
        UAT Space program. 

        If you win, we get to keep hold of our precious UAT Space pages, and program.
        If you lose... a very intelligent, greedy, and dark alien species will consume
        everthing we know of our dear UAT Space. 

        Our fate is in your mouse click. Good Luck, Cadet.
